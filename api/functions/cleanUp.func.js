This clean-up unsets that property "where", preventing Sequelize to create an undesirable INNER JOIN with it.
That's because that property stays in memory if the user has sent a request indicating a column...
...that belongs to an associated model, the property "where" for that associated model...
...remains defined for the following requests, even if no respective parameter is passed within the new requests.
